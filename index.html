        I'm just me, shaped by where I come from and what I love. I grew up in Bo, surrounded by cool traditions and tasty foods that make me proud of where I'm from. Learning about different things excites me, especially when it comes to Programming.

        Besides school stuff, I really enjoy playing piano and and going to the gym. It's my way of taking a break and having fun. Being honest, kind, and understanding is important to me. I try to live by these values in everything I do, making friends and being part of a community.

        In the end, I just want to do good things, whether it's helping out or just being a good friend. Life's an adventure, and I'm ready for it!
